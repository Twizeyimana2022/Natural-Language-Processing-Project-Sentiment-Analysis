# Natural-Language-Processing-Project-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, I fine-tuned a pre-trained Deep Learning models from HuggingFace on a new dataset to adapt the models to predict the sentiments expressed in a Tweet (e.g: neutral, positive, negative).I will then create an app to use the models and deploy the app on the HuggingFace platform.

#Overview
This is a sentiment analysis app built with Streamlit. It predicts the sentiments expressed in an input text and provides a visual representation of the sentiment scores.
 
#Setup
To run the app locally, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/eric2013/covid

2.	Navigate to the project directory:
cd sentiment-analysis-app
  
3.	Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4.	Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run sentimentapp.py
5.	Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8501 to access the app.
